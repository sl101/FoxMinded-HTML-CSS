						Biography
					</h2>
					<p>
						Of&nbsp;mixed English and American parentage, Churchill was born in&nbsp;Oxfordshire to&nbsp;a&nbsp;wealthy,
						aristocratic family. He&nbsp;joined the British Army in&nbsp;1895 and saw action in&nbsp;British India, the
						Anglo-Sudan War, and the Second Boer War, gaining fame as&nbsp;a&nbsp;war correspondent and writing books
						about his campaigns. Elected a&nbsp;Conservative MP&nbsp;in&nbsp;1900, he&nbsp;defected to&nbsp;the Liberals
						in&nbsp;1904. In&nbsp;H.&nbsp;H. Asquith&rsquo;s Liberal government, Churchill served as&nbsp;President
						of&nbsp;the Board of&nbsp;Trade and Home Secretary, championing prison reform and workers&rsquo; social
						security. As&nbsp;First Lord of&nbsp;the Admiralty during the First World War, he&nbsp;oversaw the Gallipoli
						Campaign but, after it&nbsp;proved a&nbsp;disaster, he&nbsp;was demoted to&nbsp;Chancellor of&nbsp;the Duchy
						of&nbsp;Lancaster. He&nbsp;resigned in&nbsp;November 1915 and joined the Royal Scots Fusiliers on&nbsp;the
						Western Front for six months. In&nbsp;1917, he&nbsp;returned to&nbsp;government under David Lloyd George and
						served successively as&nbsp;Minister of&nbsp;Munitions, Secretary of&nbsp;State for War, Secretary
						of&nbsp;State for Air, and Secretary of&nbsp;State for the Colonies, overseeing the Anglo-Irish Treaty and
						British foreign policy in&nbsp;the Middle East. After two years out of&nbsp;Parliament, he&nbsp;served
						as&nbsp;Chancellor of&nbsp;the Exchequer in&nbsp;Stanley Baldwin&rsquo;s Conservative government, returning
						the pound sterling in&nbsp;1925 to&nbsp;the gold standard at&nbsp;its pre-war parity, a&nbsp;move widely
						seen as&nbsp;creating deflationary pressure and depressing the&nbsp;UK economy.
					</p>
					<p>
						Out of&nbsp;government during his so-called &laquo;wilderness years&raquo; in&nbsp;the 1930s, Churchill took
						the lead in&nbsp;calling for British rearmament to&nbsp;counter the growing threat of&nbsp;militarism
						in&nbsp;Nazi Germany. At&nbsp;the outbreak of&nbsp;the Second World War he&nbsp;was re-appointed First Lord
						of&nbsp;the Admiralty. In&nbsp;May 1940, he&nbsp;became Prime Minister, replacing Neville Chamberlain.
						Churchill formed a&nbsp;national government and oversaw British involvement in&nbsp;the Allied war effort
						against the Axis powers, resulting in&nbsp;victory in&nbsp;1945. After the Conservatives&rsquo; defeat
						in&nbsp;the 1945 general election, he&nbsp;became Leader of&nbsp;the Opposition. Amid the developing Cold
						War with the Soviet Union, he&nbsp;publicly warned of&nbsp;an&nbsp;&laquo;iron curtain&raquo; of&nbsp;Soviet
						influence in&nbsp;Europe and promoted European unity. He&nbsp;lost the 1950&nbsp;election, but was returned
						to&nbsp;office in&nbsp;1951. His second term was preoccupied with foreign affairs, especially Anglo-American
						relations and the preservation of&nbsp;the British Empire. Domestically, his government emphasised
						house-building and completed the development of&nbsp;a&nbsp;nuclear weapon (begun by&nbsp;his predecessor).
						In&nbsp;declining health, Churchill resigned as&nbsp;Prime Minister in&nbsp;1955, although he&nbsp;remained
						an&nbsp;MP until 1964. Upon his death in&nbsp;1965, he&nbsp;was given a&nbsp;state funeral.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					Widely considered one of&nbsp;the 20th century&rsquo;s most significant figures, Churchill remains popular
					in&nbsp;the&nbsp;UK and Western world, where he&nbsp;is&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;victorious wartime leader who
					played an&nbsp;important role in&nbsp;defending Europe&rsquo;s liberal democracy against the spread
					of&nbsp;fascism. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;also praised as&nbsp;a&nbsp;social reformer. He&nbsp;has, however, been
					criticised for some wartime events and also for his imperialist views. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;writer, Churchill was
					awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in&nbsp;1953 for his historical and biographical work. He&nbsp;was also
					a&nbsp;prolific painter.
